# Wheelchair Digital Interface (WDI)
The Wheelchair Digital Interface (WDI) API detailed in this project is a modern, two-way communication standard for power wheelchairs built on widely accepted HID prototocols.

## Purpose
The purpose of the open WDI standard is: 
1. to allow faster development of new accessible wheelchair alternative controls by removing the need for 9-pin printer cable adapter circuits currently required to adapt to today's proprietary TRACE/DB-9 alternative drive inputs, 
2. to make current, commercially available adaptive gaming and computer interfaces available to power wheelchair users, and, 
3. to allow two-direction commumication between the power wheelchair and the controller. 

## Background
The WDI was initially conceived and developed as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Accelerator Track H project "Mobility Independence through Accelerated Wheelchair Intelligence" (NSF SP0076554) with input from a wide range of stakeholders.

## License
The WDI is open for use under an Apache 2.0 License.

## Versioning
**THE WDI IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-RELEASE.**

Versioning is handled on a major.minor.patch method, until the official WDI is released all developers will be using a version < 1.0.0. All official releases will be tagged. 

## List of Current Support
The companies and organizations listed support the open, inclusive future provided by the WDI.
